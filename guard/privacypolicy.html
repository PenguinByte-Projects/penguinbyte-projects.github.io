        <textarea readonly disabled> PenguinByte Guard only collects the data it strictly needs. Here is the data that is collected and how it’s used:
            
  1. PenguinByte Guard needs to access and read server messages for several functions like deleting messages and scanning messages for flagged words.
            
  2. PenguinByte Guard needs to know the online status of server members and their activities such as what they are playing, watching, or listening to, for our protection systems, and some commands are used to display roles, channels, or properties of the server or a member.
            
  3. PenguinByte Guard also needs to know who is in the server and their roles, nicknames, and permissions, which is necessary information for our protection systems, like the verification system which detects the member’s account age when they join and restricts their channel access if the account is not old enough, until they talk with staff. Also our other systems like the jail system, and certain functions like timing out, kicking, or banning members.
            
  DATA IS COLLECTED BUT NOT STORED.
            
  Penguinbyte Guard 2.0 is currently under active development, so with added features and commands, this privacy policy is subject to change.</textarea>
